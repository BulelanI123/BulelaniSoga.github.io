                    <p>
                        During my first semester at Rosebank College, I took an introductory course on web development that ignited my passion for the field.
                         I was immediately drawn to the endless creative possibilities that web development offered, and I became completely immersed in the world of coding. 
                        That first semester was a turning point that set me on the path to pursuing web development as a career.

                    <p>
                        In my second year, I realized the potential for online learning and began exploring courses. 
                        I started with a digital marketing course offered by Google, which provided insights into how websites could be used for marketing. 
                        I became fascinated by digital marketing and gained valuable skills that have proven useful in my work as a web developer.

                    <p>
                        I credit my significant improvement in responsive web development skills to my completion of a 300-hour course on FreeCodeCamp.
                         This program challenged me to develop a deep understanding of responsive design principles and apply them effectively to a range of web development projects.
                          The repetition built into the course allowed me to develop muscle memory for the key concepts, which has proven invaluable in my day-to-day work as a web developer.
<br/>
                        Not only did I gain valuable knowledge and skills from the program, but I was also awarded a certificate from FreeCodeCamp upon completion. This recognition was a major accomplishment for me and provided me with added confidence as I continued to grow my expertise in the field.
                        I remain deeply grateful for the opportunities that FreeCodeCamp has provided me in my journey as a web developer.

                         However, I also came to the realization that by continuing to learn, grow, and promote my skills, I could achieve my financial goals and build a successful career in web development.
<br/>
                        I made a conscious decision to invest time and effort into improving my skills and building my personal brand, knowing that this would be key to my future success.
